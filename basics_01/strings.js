// strings in js  
// a string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. Strings are commonly used for storing and manipulating textual 
//data in computer programs. They can be manipulated using various operations like concatenation, substring extraction, and comparison.
// string literals - single quotes or double quotes 
// let name = 'John';

let n = "john";
// let n = 'john';
console.log(n);
console.log(n.length);
console.log(n[0]);
console.log(n[1]);

// template literals
let boy1 = "John";
let boy2 = "Jake";
let sentence = `${boy1} is a friend of ${boy2}`;// interpolation 
console.log(sentence);

//escape sequence characters
let fruit = 'bana\'na'//  escaping the quote so it doesn't   , same for double quotes
console.log(fruit)
